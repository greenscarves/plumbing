Welcome to the Green Scarves plumbing project!

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Tech Stack
Our tech stack currently uses Auth0, Next.js, Node.js, and MySQL/Prisma.

We intend on also using a shell script titled Cell Ranger, but it is only runnable on Linux machines,
which none of us have. Our client is in the process of setting up a Google Cloud server for us to use.
